Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. Soil also requires fertilisation to remain fertile, preferably through natural or organic processes. Where farming is carried out in a way that is unsympathetic to the land in places where climatic conditions mean the soil is already under stress, this can eventually result in desertification.

Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes permaculture, originally being a combination of the words permanent and agriculture, which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem.","user":"That sounds like organic farming.

Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow’s milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job. That means that soy milk is also the best choice when making vegan buttermilk for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits or for dredging to make breaded dishes like “Chicken-Fried” Tofu Steaks.","user":"What would be second best?"},{"turnNumber":"9","system":"The next time I'm in a pinch and soy or hemp milk can't be found I'll turn to almond milk as a third alternative and if I can't find this I'll go on the lookout for coconut milk, followed by rice milk.

In vegan baking we're using so little of it that if you're concerned about it you really shouldn't be eating baked items in the first place because the sugar and glycemic index issues are a much more serious health issue. Remember that most things in moderation are ok. If you're still concerned or allergic to soy then it's great that we now have hemp milk as a soy-free alternative. Its wonderful to finally be in an age where we have so many alternatives to dairy milk to choose from.","user":"What is the best in my morning latte?"}]}

Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car.","user":"How fast did it go?","history":[{"turnNumber":"1","user":"I saw a Tesla Roadster today which made me wonder, what is the world’s fastest car?"},{"turnNumber":"2","system":"Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 2:112.

Today the Hennessey Venom GT promises to set a new standard of power to weight ratio in the rarified air of today’s supercar market.”With such a light-weight body and astronomical horsepower, the Hennessey Venom GT can sprint from 0 – 60 in just 2.2 seconds with a top speed of 262 mph on a six-speed manual transmission. Compared to the Bugatti Veyron, which has an acceleration speed from 0 – 60 mph in 2.6 seconds with a top speed of 253 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT may be the “Veyron-killer”. To stop this venomous beast, Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers are added in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear to give enough clamping power on the massive 15-inch carbon ceramic rotors. Hennessey plans on building 10 units of the Venom GT yearly.

Tesla's claims and independent testing show that the Roadster can reach 60 mph in about four seconds and its speed will top out somewhere around 130 mph.

The unique properties of an electric motor give it a huge advantage over a combustion engine in terms of torque, force that tends to rotate or turn things, and power band, the range of operating speeds under which the engine operates efficiently. The Roadster can generate large amounts of torque even at very low RPM, and the motor can always turn out major horsepower. It can reach over 13,000 RPM, something very few large combustion engines can do.”","user":"I heard they’ve been working on something even faster."}]}

For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that.

Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa. This engagement, however, has typically been minimized or ignored outright in the retelling of the events. Here’s what you need to know. Who are the Feminist Coalition?

It raised and managed funds for the movement, established a legal aid service made up of volunteers, and coordinated help lines to align efforts across the country. Nigeria’s Feminist Coalition capitalizes on mobile apps Communication technologies have facilitated the #EndSARS protests. The online mobilization effort has garnered global support, generating over 28 million tweets within 48 hours of the online campaign’s kickoff on Oct. 8. The speed and reach of new technologies have enabled efficient communication of information for community building and collaboration. These technologies also helped the #EndSARS movement navigate the Nigerian government’s responses to the protests. Through WhatsApp and Twitter, activists shared information, reaching a wide network of supporters. Real-time transmission of texts, pictures and videos of the protests and violence by police and soldiers also prompted swift domestic and international condemnation of the Nigerian government.","user":"There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier.

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem.","user":"How dangerous could these be?","history":[{"turnNumber":"1","user":"My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently.

There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though.

That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks.

As a solution, scientists are currently looking for and breeding rust-resistant coffee varieties (USAID recently donated $5 million towards this goal). Still, there are even reasons to think that these efforts will be futile. Coffee doesn't have a very broad genetic base,Lombardini says. It originated from just a few plants that were taken out of Ethiopia a few hundred years ago, so it has a very narrow, homogenous genome.

{"conversation":123,"turnNumber":"6","system":"Conclusion Any exercise is bad for you if you overdo it. You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness.

It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic.

Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area.

Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel.

How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof).","user":"That sounds like a lot of water.

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent.

Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary.

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent.

Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior.

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice.","user":"How many years will it take to recoup the investment?","history":[{"turnNumber":"1","user":"I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working.

Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there.

In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement.","user":"Tell me about AC systems."}]}

First, pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. Second, as our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions. Third, melting ice caps, ice sheets and glaciers, as well as expanding warming waters, will lead to rising sea levels. Rising sea levels could push saltwater into freshwater aquifers, making the water unusable for drinking or irrigation.

A homemade body scrub helps moisturize and exfoliate the skin, and with cold weather approaching it will make a killer gift this winter.

Feel free to get creative and fancy when making these scrubs; here is the basic recipe you can use to make a few batches. You’ll need 2 cups Epsom salts or sugar (use organic cane sugar, brown sugar, or regular granulated), 1 cup carrier oil (grapeseed, olive, sweet almond, sesame, and safflower are all good), and 8-10 drops of your favourite essential oil. First, add Epsom salts or sugar to a bowl and slowly begin stirring in the oil until the mixture is smooth, but not goopy (You may not need the full cup of oil). Then, add essential oil and any other fun additions and mix well. Spoon into a decorative container or glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. You should choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub.

Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time. The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights. To start, your body’s weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix.

Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often. Be generous with your compliments. When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds. It encourages them to do even better next time. Always express yourself and let them know how good and proud you feel to have them as your kid. 3.

Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized. The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar. The city-state was also a center of slave trade. where slaves were exchanged for European goods. The main ethnic group took out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area. Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships were from Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Conditions were brutal. In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding. By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety. They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.","user":"Where did the name Calabar come about then?","history":[{"turnNumber":"1-1","user":"A friend asked me to tell him something interesting about Nigeria.

A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the greater fool theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.

{"conversation":149,"turnNumber":"2-7","system":"When you use a search engine, relevant results are extracted from the index and ranked using an algorithm. Algorithms may seem like “objectively” mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let’s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. ​ ​ Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.​ ​ Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any “black-sounding” names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans. Automation means we will create blind spots and racist biases in our so-called objective algorithms.","user":"In terms of their ranking though, how does it work?","history":[{"turnNumber":"1-1","user":"Are search engines biased?"},{"turnNumber":"1-3","system":"Search engines are not magically impartial arbiters.
