Party Jollof rice is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over firewood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavor. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavor. Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.  To prevent this, Ghanaians prepare the tomato stew and meat stock and use that to cook the rice at once. Ghanian Jollof rice is also spicier than Nigerian Jollof.

Rice made with tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets, and chili peppers. There are endless variations on this recipe, but those five ingredients are usual constants. No list of Nigerian foods can be complete without a mention of Jollof rice.

Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy. Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate. On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof. Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to decide which Jollof tastes better. Hilarious! The Ghanaians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media. You won\u2019t blame them. With the ferocity of attack they get from Nigerians on social media, it\u2019s pretty easy to think Nigerian Jollof rice tastes better.

Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria but imported from Asian countries. A second difference is the method of cooking. The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content. Party Jollof rice is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over firewood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavor. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavor. Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.  To prevent this, Ghanaians prepare the tomato stew and meat stock and use that to cook the rice at once. Ghanian Jollof rice is also spicier than Nigerian Jollof.

The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanaians and Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.

Algorithms may seem like \u201cobjectively\u201d mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let\u2019s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. \u200b \u200b Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.\u200b \u200b Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any \u201cblack-sounding\u201d names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans.
